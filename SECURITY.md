# Security Policy

I don't think there can be any vulnerabilities whatsoever. 
If there are, it might be related to Skript/Minecraft/Java, so please make sure that you are using the latest version of them.
There is also a chance that the script permissions are wrongfully set, or there are some flaws resulting in exploits/duping, and if that is the case, please refer to the information below on how to report the vulnerability.
Please note that we will not be liable for any damages, as written in the license.
We suggest backing up your server periodically, as it is always a smart move.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
