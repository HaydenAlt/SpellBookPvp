# Want to contribute?
Although we respect every contribution, some of them might not be needed.\
We suggest going to the issues tab and finding issues that have the "Contribution Needed" label.\
Please also leave a message on issues that you will be working on so that 2 people won't contribute at the same time.\
Please complete it within a week to keep things moving. Leave a message if you could not complete it.

# Guidelines
1. Share and make whatever ideas that come to your mind, there is no right or wrong on that, although we might say no, we still value every contribution.
2. Being tidy will be greatly appreciated. While it is not necessary in conversations, it is a must for contributions.
3. Say whatever you want, just keep in mind that respect is a two-way street. Keep foul language or attacks out of conversations. Speak facts.
