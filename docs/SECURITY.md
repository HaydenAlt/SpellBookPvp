# Security Policy

I don't think there can be any vulnerabilities whatsoever. 
If there are, it might be related to Skript/Minecraft, so please make sure that you are using the latest version of them.
There is also a chance that the script permissions are wrongfully set, or there are some flaws resulting in exploits/duping, and if that is the case, please refer to the information below on how to report the vulnerability.
Please note that we will not be liable for any damages, as written in the license.
We suggest backing up your server periodically, as it is always a smart move.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please be sure that it is an issue or a bug with the code.
You can use the "issues" tab in that case.
If you are not sure, you can check the list in our [support file](https://github.com/HaydenAlt/SpellBookPvp/blob/main/SUPPORT.md).
You can also dm me directly on Discord. My username is PeaceGodH.
Any major vulnerabilities or bugs should be fixed within a week.
