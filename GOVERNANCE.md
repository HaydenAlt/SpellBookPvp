The governance structure of this project is “Benevolent Dictator for Life” BDFL.
This means, although I really, really value ideas, opinions, and discussions, I still have the final say on all major project decisions; no argument can change that. 
This does not matter to most of you, I guess you're just bored and just opening all the files once?
Yeah, "governance" sounds nerdy... Anyways, have fun!
