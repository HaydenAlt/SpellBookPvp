# SpellBookPvp
Made for Minecraft: Java Edition servers using Bukkit loader with skript installed to provide a magical pvp experience.

# Tools for contributors
If you have made an ability, you can choose to create your very own magic circle.
There is a tool in the root folder that generates random settings.
You will need to generate and send the following information along with your contribution:
1. Generate a pattern until you are satisfied and copy the 10-digit code.
2. A color code that you generated or found online. It is best not to repeat or be too similar to the ones before.
3. A particle type, note that you will also need extra data for some of them.
