# SpellBookPvp
Made for Minecraft: Java Edition servers using Bukkit loader with skript installed to provide a magical pvp experience.

# Tools
There are currently a few tools to help you create your very own magic circle.
There is a Python program in the functions folder, which can modify results generated from kemo14331's Particle-Converter so that it is in the latest format.
There is also an explorer that generates random settings and a pattern that is generated by CiaccoDavide's Alchemy-Circles-Generator.

# Special Thanks
Special thanks to [kemo14331](https://github.com/kemo14331) for the [Particle-Converter](https://github.com/kemo14331/Particle-Converter), although outdated and it has notbeen  updated since 2023, it still helped me greatly!
Special thanks to [CiaccoDavide](https://github.com/CiaccoDavide) for the [Alchemy-Circles-Generator](https://github.com/CiaccoDavide/Alchemy-Circles-Generator), it is genuinely amazing!
