Share whatever ideas that come to your mind, there is no right or wrong on that, and we value every opinion.
Even if there is no format, it is fineee we'll understand (Although having one is greatly appreciated!)

Say whatever you want, just keep in mind that respect is a two-way street.
Keep foul language or attacks out of conversations. Speak facts.
